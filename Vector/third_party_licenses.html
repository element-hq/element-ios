            You can use DOC software in commercial and/or binary software releases and are
            under no obligation to redistribute any of your source code that is built
            using DOC software. Note, however, that you may not misappropriate the DOC
            software code, such as copyrighting it yourself or claiming authorship of the
            DOC software code, in a way that will prevent DOC software from being
            distributed freely using an open-source development model. You needn't inform
            anyone that you're using DOC software in your software, though we encourage
            you to let us know so we can promote your project in the DOC software success

            for DOC software, however. DOC software is Y2K-compliant, as long as the
            underlying OS platform is Y2K-compliant. Likewise, DOC software is compliant
            with the new US daylight savings rule passed by Congress as &quot;The Energy Policy
            Act of 2005,&quot; which established new daylight savings times (DST) rules for the
            United States that expand DST as of March 2007. Since DOC software obtains
            time/date and calendaring information from operating systems users will not be
            affected by the new DST rules as long as they upgrade their operating systems
            accordingly.

            License:
            This license governs use of code marked as “sample” or “example” available on
            this web site without a license agreement, as provided under the section above
            titled “NOTICE SPECIFIC TO SOFTWARE AVAILABLE ON THIS WEB SITE.” If you use
            such code (the “software”), you accept this license. If you do not accept the
            license, do not use the software.

            1. Definitions

            The terms “reproduce,” “reproduction,” “derivative works,” and “distribution”
            have the same meaning here as under U.S. copyright law.

            A “contribution” is the original software, or any additions or changes to the
            software.

            A “contributor” is any person that distributes its contribution under this
            license.

            “Licensed patents” are a contributor’s patent claims that read directly on its
            contribution.

            2. Grant of Rights

            (A) Copyright Grant - Subject to the terms of this license, including the
            license conditions and limitations in section 3, each contributor grants you a
            non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce its
            contribution, prepare derivative works of its contribution, and distribute its
            contribution or any derivative works that you create.

            (B) Patent Grant - Subject to the terms of this license, including the license
            conditions and limitations in section 3, each contributor grants you a
            non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license under its licensed patents to
            make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale, import, and/or otherwise dispose
            of its contribution in the software or derivative works of the contribution in
            the software.

            3. Conditions and Limitations

            (A) No Trademark License- This license does not grant you rights to use any
            contributors’ name, logo, or trademarks.

            (B) If you bring a patent claim against any contributor over patents that you
            claim are infringed by the software, your patent license from such contributor
            to the software ends automatically.

            (C) If you distribute any portion of the software, you must retain all
            copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices that are present in the
            software.

            (D) If you distribute any portion of the software in source code form, you may
            do so only under this license by including a complete copy of this license
            with your distribution. If you distribute any portion of the software in
            compiled or object code form, you may only do so under a license that complies
            with this license.

            (E) The software is licensed “as-is.” You bear the risk of using it. The
            contributors give no express warranties, guarantees or conditions. You may
            have additional consumer rights under your local laws which this license
            cannot change. To the extent permitted under your local laws, the contributors
            exclude the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular
            purpose and non-infringement.

            (F) Platform Limitation - The licenses granted in sections 2(A) and 2(B)
            extend only to the software or derivative works that you create that run on a
            Microsoft Windows operating system product.

            BoringSSL is a fork of OpenSSL. As such, large parts of it fall under OpenSSL
            licensing. Files that are completely new have a Google copyright and an ISC
            license. This license is reproduced at the bottom of this file.

            Contributors to BoringSSL are required to follow the CLA rules for Chromium:
            https://cla.developers.google.com/clas

            Some files from Intel are under yet another license, which is also included
            underneath.

            The OpenSSL toolkit stays under a dual license, i.e. both the conditions of the
            OpenSSL License and the original SSLeay license apply to the toolkit. See below
            for the actual license texts. Actually both licenses are BSD-style Open Source
            licenses. In case of any license issues related to OpenSSL please contact
            openssl-core@openssl.org.

            The following are Google-internal bug numbers where explicit permission from
            some authors is recorded for use of their work. (This is purely for our own

            The JsonCpp library's source code, including accompanying documentation,
            tests and demonstration applications, are licensed under the following
            conditions...

            The author (Baptiste Lepilleur) explicitly disclaims copyright in all
            jurisdictions which recognize such a disclaimer. In such jurisdictions,
            this software is released into the Public Domain.

            In jurisdictions which do not recognize Public Domain property (e.g. Germany as of
            2010), this software is Copyright (c) 2007-2010 by Baptiste Lepilleur, and is
            released under the terms of the MIT License (see below).

            In jurisdictions which recognize Public Domain property, the user of this
            software may choose to accept it either as 1) Public Domain, 2) under the
            conditions of the MIT License (see below), or 3) under the terms of dual
            Public Domain/MIT License conditions described here, as they choose.

            The MIT License is about as close to Public Domain as a license can get, and is
            described in clear, concise terms at:

            http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License

            The full text of the MIT License follows:

            The MIT license is compatible with both the GPL and commercial
            software, affording one all of the rights of Public Domain with the
            minor nuisance of being required to keep the above copyright notice
            and license text in the source code. Note also that by accepting the
            Public Domain &quot;license&quot; you can re-license your copy using whatever
            license you like.
