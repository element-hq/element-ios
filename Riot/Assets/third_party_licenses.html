                    particular purpose, noninfringement, or arising from a course of dealing,

                    University, their employees, and students shall have no liability with respect
                    to the infringement of copyrights, trade secrets or any patents by DOC
                    software or any part thereof. Moreover, in no event will Washington

                    DOC software is provided with no support and without any obligation on the
                    part of Washington University, UC Irvine, Vanderbilt University, their
                    employees, or students to assist in its use, correction, modification, or
                    enhancement. A number of companies around the world provide commercial support
                    for DOC software, however. DOC software is Y2K-compliant, as long as the
                    underlying OS platform is Y2K-compliant. Likewise, DOC software is compliant
                    with the new US daylight savings rule passed by Congress as &quot;The Energy Policy
                    Act of 2005,&quot; which established new daylight savings times (DST) rules for the
                    United States that expand DST as of March 2007. Since DOC software obtains
                    time/date and calendaring information from operating systems users will not be
                    affected by the new DST rules as long as they upgrade their operating systems
                    accordingly.

                    1. Definitions
                    
                    The terms “reproduce,” “reproduction,” “derivative works,” and “distribution”
                    have the same meaning here as under U.S. copyright law.
                    
                    A “contribution” is the original software, or any additions or changes to the
                    software.
                    
                    A “contributor” is any person that distributes its contribution under this
                    license.
                    
                    “Licensed patents” are a contributor’s patent claims that read directly on its
                    contribution.
                    
                    2. Grant of Rights
                    
                    (A) Copyright Grant - Subject to the terms of this license, including the

                    contribution, prepare derivative works of its contribution, and distribute its
                    contribution or any derivative works that you create.
                    
                    (B) Patent Grant - Subject to the terms of this license, including the license
                    conditions and limitations in section 3, each contributor grants you a

                    of its contribution in the software or derivative works of the contribution in
                    the software.
                    
                    3. Conditions and Limitations
                    
                    (A) No Trademark License- This license does not grant you rights to use any

                    BoringSSL is a fork of OpenSSL. As such, large parts of it fall under OpenSSL
                    licensing. Files that are completely new have a Google copyright and an ISC
                    license. This license is reproduced at the bottom of this file.
                    
                    Contributors to BoringSSL are required to follow the CLA rules for Chromium:

                    Some files from Intel are under yet another license, which is also included
                    underneath.
                    
                    The OpenSSL toolkit stays under a dual license, i.e. both the conditions of the
                    OpenSSL License and the original SSLeay license apply to the toolkit. See below
                    for the actual license texts. Actually both licenses are BSD-style Open Source
                    licenses. In case of any license issues related to OpenSSL please contact

                    jurisdictions which recognize such a disclaimer. In such jurisdictions,
                    this software is released into the Public Domain.
                    
                    In jurisdictions which do not recognize Public Domain property (e.g. Germany as of
                    2010), this software is Copyright (c) 2007-2010 by Baptiste Lepilleur, and is
                    released under the terms of the MIT License (see below).
                    
                    In jurisdictions which recognize Public Domain property, the user of this
                    software may choose to accept it either as 1) Public Domain, 2) under the
                    conditions of the MIT License (see below), or 3) under the terms of dual
                    Public Domain/MIT License conditions described here, as they choose.
                    
                    The MIT License is about as close to Public Domain as a license can get, and is
                    described in clear, concise terms at:
                    
                    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License
                    
                    The full text of the MIT License follows:

                    The MIT license is compatible with both the GPL and commercial
                    software, affording one all of the rights of Public Domain with the

                    and license text in the source code. Note also that by accepting the
                    Public Domain &quot;license&quot; you can re-license your copy using whatever
                    license you like.

        TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

        1. Definitions.

        "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
        and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

        "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
        the copyright owner that is granting the License.

        "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
        other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
        control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,

        direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
        otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the

        exercising permissions granted by this License.

        "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
        including but not limited to software source code, documentation
        source, and configuration files.

        "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
        transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
        not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
        and conversions to other media types.

        "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
        Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
        copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
        (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

        "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
        form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
        editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
        represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
        of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
        separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
        the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

        "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
        the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
        to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
        submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
        or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
        the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
        means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
        to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
        communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
        and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
        Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
        excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
        designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

        "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
        on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
        subsequently incorporated within the Work.

        2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
        this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
        worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
        copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
        publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
        Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

        3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
        this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
        worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
        (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
        use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
        where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
        by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
        Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
        with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
        institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
        cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
        or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
        or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
        granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
        as of the date such litigation is filed.

        4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
        Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
        modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
        meet the following conditions:

        (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
        Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

        (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
        stating that You changed the files; and

        (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
        that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
        attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
        excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
        the Derivative Works; and

        (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
        distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
        include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
        within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
        pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
        of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
        as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
        documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
        within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
        wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
        of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
        do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
        notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
        or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
        that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
        as modifying the License.

        You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
        may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
        for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
        for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
        reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
        the conditions stated in this License.

        5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
        any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
        by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
        this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
        Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
        the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
        with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

        6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
        names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
        except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
        origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

        7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
        agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
        Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
        WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
        implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
        of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
        PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
        appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
        risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

        8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
        whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
        unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
        negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
        liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
        incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
        result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
        Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
        work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
        other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
        has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

        9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
        the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
        and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
        or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
        License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
        on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
        of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
        defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
        incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
        of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

        <br/><br/>TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
            <br/><br/>1. Definitions.
            <br/><br/>"License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
             and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
             <br/><br/>"Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
             the copyright owner that is granting the License.
             <br/><br/>"Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
             other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
             control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
             "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
             direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
             otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
             outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
             <br/><br/>"You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
             exercising permissions granted by this License.
             <br/><br/>"Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
             including but not limited to software source code, documentation
             source, and configuration files.
             <br/><br/>"Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
             transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
             not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
             and conversions to other media types.
             <br/><br/>"Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
             Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
             copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
             (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
             <br/><br/>"Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
             form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
             editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
             represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
             of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
             separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
             the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
             <br/><br/>"Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
             the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
             to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
             submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
             or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
             the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
             means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
             to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
             communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
             and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
             Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
             excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
             designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
             <br/><br/>"Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
             on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
             subsequently incorporated within the Work.
             <br/><br/>2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
             this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
             worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
             copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
             publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
             Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
             <br/><br/>3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
             this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
             worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
             (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
             use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
             where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
             by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
             Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
             with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
             institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
             cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
             or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
             or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
             granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
             as of the date such litigation is filed.
             <br/><br/>4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
             Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
             modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
             meet the following conditions:
             <br/><br/>(a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                 Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
             <br/><br/>(b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                 stating that You changed the files; and
             <br/><br/>(c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                 that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                 attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                 excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                 the Derivative Works; and
             <br/><br/>(d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                 distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                 include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                 within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                 pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                 of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                 as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                 documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                 within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                 wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                 of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                 do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                 notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                 or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                 that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                 as modifying the License.
             <br/><br/>You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
             may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
             for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
             for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
             reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
             the conditions stated in this License.
             <br/><br/>5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
             any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
             by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
             this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
             Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
             the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
             with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
             <br/><br/>6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
             names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
             except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
             origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
             <br/><br/>7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
             agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
             Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
             WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
             implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
             of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
             PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
             appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
             risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
             <br/><br/>8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
             whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
             unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
             negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
             liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
             incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
             result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
             Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
             work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
             other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
             has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
             <br/><br/>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
             the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
             and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
             or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
             License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
             on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
             of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
             defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
             incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
             of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
