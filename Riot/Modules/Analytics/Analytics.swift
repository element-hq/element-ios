/// Events may include user activity, or app health data such as crashes,
/// non-fatal issues and performance. `Analytics` class serves as a fa√ßade
/// to all these use cases.
///
/// ## Creating Analytics Events
///
/// Events are managed in a shared repo for all Element clients https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-analytics-events
/// To add a new event create a PR to that repo with the new/updated schema. Element's Podfile has
/// a local version of the pod (commented out) for development purposes.
/// Once merged into `main`, follow the steps below to integrate the changes into the project:
/// 1. Check if `main` contains any source breaking changes to the events. If so, please
/// wait until you are ready to merge your work into element-ios.
/// 2. Merge `main` into the `release/swift` branch.
/// 3. Run `bundle exec pod update AnalyticsEvents` to update the pod.
/// 4. Make sure to commit `Podfile.lock` with the new commit hash.
